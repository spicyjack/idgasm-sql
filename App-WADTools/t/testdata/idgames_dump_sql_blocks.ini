params : Action Doom is meant to try and bring back the run and gun feeling from the old 2D shooters like Contra and Metal Slug. In the tradition of such games there are no bullet weapons, only projectiles. And just like Contra every enemy and subsequently you, all have but one hit point, aside from bosses and mini bosses.<br><br> To make the game feel more 2D and less frustrating, you will never be attacked from behind, and the level is entirely linnear.

params : GROVE- THE STORY CONTINUES (...from where?)- In your garden, you can sometimes see an angry looking fat dude steal your mushrooms. He's Smugla. Whenever he takes them, he leaps into a deep hole in the floor like a rabbit. You've never catched him. One day you think "Gee- I wonder why he lives in the ground?" So one day, taking your pistol to blow that mushroom stealer to bits, you jump down the hole. "Lets see how he enjoys my mushrooms now!"... Whatever that means. You hit the bottom of the hole, and you see the hole continue horizontally down. So you go down it, and hit a dead end. But then, you look up, and see another hole out "ha HA!" you retort. You climb out the hole, and look around- "Umm... where the hell am I?" You say, as you see the red skied, gold stared, tree covered, 7 frame per second frame rate world of Grove. You get out of the hole, and see Smugla's house infront of you, with HIS mushroom garden, which are really your mushrooms that he stole. You might as well take them. They are yours- even if it would anger him. Where is he anyway?<br><br> There is a map in his house, showing his X on it. Hmm. I wonder why he wants to go there? Well, he IS a trans-galactical mushroom stealer - maybe its a huge mushroom grove? or maybe an opportunity to get other mushrooms from other dimensions? Who knows. Do you? You do don't you- don't lie. Tell me- TELL ME!! <br><br> END OF STUPID STORY<br><br> P.S- Sorry about all those trees. Its a relatively small level anyway. You just have to be observant at times and a good shooter. The ammo can be pretty tight at times I guess. You'd probably just IDDQD, IDKFA it to the end won't you. Tsk tsk.

Well, who else could be mor qualified as the ZDoom.org community itself? :) That was the day, when I opened a new thread over at the ZDoom forums and telling those people my plans, and the rest is just history which can be read over at: http://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=2935 By the way, this is the longest thread ever in the history of Forums@ZDoom.org with over 1000 replies (no spam) and over 10.000 views, amazing, isn't it? :) Thx goes to all the contributors, they really worked hard and also very fast, so this could be released within one month of developement!

params :   This WAD tells the true story of what REALLY happened in the   recent episode at the NewDooM forums.  My sources are infallible,   so don't even try to dismiss any of this as false, because it is   the cold, hard truth and it will hit you like a speeding bus in   the middle of a rainy night.  It's that powerful.

params : In one of the final battles there's a portal (you'll know it when you see it) that will break on you. It should work, but I'm smarter than ZDoom, so it breaks after a while. To prevent this as long as possible try not to go down into the grassy area, though it will still probably break on its own anyway. Too bad, it's a cool effect so it stays in there. I'd also advise against gamesaves or cheating in that area for related reasons.
